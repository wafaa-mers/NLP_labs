        "- **Simple BPE:** Uses `</w>` at the end of each word.\n",
        "- **SentencePiece:** Uses `_` (underscore) at the beginning of each word.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "- Simple BPE: `\"low</w> est</w>\"`\n",

        "### 2. Tokenization approach:\n",
        "- **Simple BPE:** Tokenizes words first, then applies BPE.\n",
        "- **SentencePiece:** Treats the entire input as a sequence of characters, including spaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "- Simple BPE: `[\"low</w>\", \"est</w>\"]`\n",
